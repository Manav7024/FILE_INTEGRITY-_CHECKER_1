#DESCRIPTION: This Python script maintains file integrity over time by calculating and comparing hash values, thereby monitoring changes in files located within a specified directory. It utilizes the "hashlib" module to generate SHA-256 hashes for the files. The computed hashes are stored in a file named file_hashes.json. To detect modifications, the script contrasts the saved hashes with the current states of the files. Any alteration to a file results in a change in its hash, which is subsequently identified and reported. Files that have been deleted are flagged if they were previously recorded but are no longer present, while new files are recognized when they appear in the directory without an existing record. This script serves as a valuable tool for auditing changes in critical directories, verifying backups, and ensuring file integrity. It operates effectively with all file types, including .docx.
