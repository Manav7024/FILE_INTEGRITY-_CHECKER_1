#DESCRIPTION: This Python script maintains file integrity over time by calculating and comparing hash values, thereby monitoring changes in files located within a specified directory. It utilizes the "hashlib" module to generate SHA-512 hashes for the files. To detect modifications, the script contrasts the saved hashes with the current states of the files. Any alteration to a file results in a change in its hash, which is subsequently identified and reported. Files that are altered are flagged with "FILES MODIFIED" statement, while authentic files are flagged with "FILE IS INTACT" statemnet. This script serves as a valuable tool for auditing changes in critical directories, verifying backups, and ensuring file integrity. It operates effectively with all file types, including .docx.
